## Felewin Website Template

This is the template I use to create most websites. For instance, http://hunterbobeck.com.

Some basic formatting is demonstrated in the [template site HTML](index.html) as an example.

Provides many common CSS rules; also includes useful packages such as Bootstrap, Wow, Reset, and more. Keep in mind those packages' licenses.
